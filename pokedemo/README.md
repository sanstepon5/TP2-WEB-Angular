## Application details
The app retrieves automatically 25 first pokemons from PokeAPI. You can then retrieve additional pokemons
by writing their ID or name and then clicking on the "GO" button. 

By default, the app displays the entire list of pokemons. To display only the selected pokemon, select it
using the drop-down menu from the list and uncheck the slider button.
